# Auto-XSS v1.0

Auto-XSS is a tool designed for educational purposes to demonstrate the risks associated with cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. It automates a simulated XSS attack using a bit.ly URL to redirect users to a malicious JavaScript payload, aiming to raise awareness about potential security threats.

## How it works?

Auto-XSS leverages social engineering techniques to persuade users into executing malicious code within their browsers. By creating a redirect URL using bit.ly, the tool attempts to bypass security measures that block direct JavaScript injections. When users unwittingly run the provided code, their browser may send authenticated session cookies to the attacker, highlighting the danger of XSS vulnerabilities.

## Features:

- Simplified XSS attack demonstration
- Integration with popular port forwarding services like Serveo or Ngrok for testing in live environments

## Legal disclaimer:

The usage of Auto-XSS for attacking targets without explicit consent is strictly prohibited and may be illegal in many jurisdictions. Users are advised to adhere to all applicable laws and ethical guidelines when using this tool. The developers of Auto-XSS assume no liability for any misuse or damages resulting from its usage.

## Usage:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hackelite01/auto-xss
